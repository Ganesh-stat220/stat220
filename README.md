# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Math and Stat
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to leaen the importnace of data. 
- I am interested in learning about what exactly statical Computing is and possibly get look for jobs in that field.
