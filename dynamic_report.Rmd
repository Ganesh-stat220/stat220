## What's going on with this data?

You need to change the contents of this Rmd! Replace the R code and markdown give below in this template document.

```{r}
summary_stats <- list(
  avg_posts = mean(latest_data$posts_scrolled, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_rating = mean(latest_data$useful_rating, na.rm = TRUE),
  min_posts = min(latest_data$posts_scrolled, na.rm = TRUE),
  max_rating = max(latest_data$useful_rating, na.rm = TRUE)
)

summary_stats
```
```{r}
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = posts_scrolled)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Posts Scrolled Before Seeing Ads",
       x = "Number of Posts Scrolled",
       y = "Count")

# Bar Chart 2: Distribution of usefulness ratings
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = useful_rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "coral") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Advertisement Usefulness Ratings",
       x = "Usefulness Rating (1-10)",
       y = "Count")

# Bar Chart 3: Average usefulness by posts scrolled (for exploration)
ggplot(latest_data, aes(x = factor(posts_scrolled), y = useful_rating)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Average Usefulness by Posts Scrolled",

       y = "Average Usefulness Rating")

This report analyses how I interact with ads on my Instagram page by comparing how many posts I have to scroll through to get an ad and how useful/targeted that ad is to me personally. 

Most of the ads are not useful for me at all as they are just mobile games or travel stuff, I don't have any money to travel ANY TIME SOON. But the reason why I might be trageted with these ads might be because I went to India during the holidays and spent some time in Singapore as well. With the mobile ads, maybe it's because the amount of Clash Royal I play.

Also another key finding is that it doesn't take long to receive an ad on average after scrolling pat 3 posts I'm hit with an ad. This might be because most on the posts that I'm seeing aren't by people I follow rather just random meme accounts that are just popping on my feed. This might be different if I'm follow more accounts that actually post stuff rather than 99% of my followings being my friends and family and the 1% is news/sport/gaming pages.
